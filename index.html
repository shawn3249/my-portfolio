            <p>I am SHAWN AHMED. I'm from Bangladesh. I'm 22 years old. I'm a student at Daffodil International
                University's computer science and engineering department. I am a person who is positive about every
                aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, see, and experience. I like to read, I like to
                write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in
                the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night, and I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I
                am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation I may find myself. For I have learned that
                the greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our
                disposition.
